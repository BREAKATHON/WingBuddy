# Contrubitions

## How to contribute

You can start either with a pull request or by checking the communication channels section.

## Communication channels

Under construction. For now we have the slack channels that were used during the hackathon. You can reach out here on github to any of the existing contributors to inquire for an invite, since the slack still contains personal info. We will likely soon look for a longterm mode of project communication and community building!
